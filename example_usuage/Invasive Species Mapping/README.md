IAS_mapping_Example.ipynb - This notebook contains an end-to-end example that includes preparing cloud free composites, extracting data at locations, training a model and visualising the results. Data imports and exports are also covered.

IAS_mapping_wUQ.ipynb - Builds on the previous workflow (IAS_mapping_Example) to also include UQ. Code to also create publication figures (Figure 2C and Figure 6) are also included. This code was used for the research paper.

It is recommended that users first understand the steps taken in the IAS_mapping_Example.ipynb and then proceeding the UQ notebook.
