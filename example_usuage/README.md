The code for each of the three case studies are included in the Dynamic World, GEDI and Invasive species mapping folder. This code includes notebooks to quantify uncertainty, train a conformal quantile regression model, visualise the results, create and export publication ready figures.

Outside of these three case studies, there are notebooks that show 
1) how to create gap+cloud-free compsosites for Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (Create_composites.ipynb).  
2) how to upload a shapefile to Google Earth Engine programattically (gee_shp_upload.ipynb).
